# SMART-GASP
This repository contains the code of the **SMART-GASP algorithm, an end-to-end machine learning integrated genetic algorithm for crystal structure prediction, containing a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network Structure Generator (WGANsg) 
for population initialization and tournament based scoring/selection (TBS) of candidate offspring organisms through equivariant graph based score networks via MatterSim.

# Getting SMART-GASP

## 1. STEP 1
- While not mandatory, we recommend creating a clean conda environment before installing SMART-GASP to avoid potential package conflicts. You can create and activate a conda environment with the following commands:
- ```bash conda create -n smart_gasp python=3.10 -y```

# Activate the environment
conda activate smart_gasp

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
