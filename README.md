# SMART-GASP
This repository contains the code of the **SMART-GASP algorithm, an end-to-end machine learning integrated genetic algorithm for crystal structure prediction, containing a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network Structure Generator (WGANsg) 
for population initialization and tournament based scoring/selection (TBS) of candidate offspring organisms through equivariant graph based score networks via MatterSim.

# Getting SMART-GASP

## 1. Create Conda Environment
- While not mandatory, we recommend creating a clean conda environment before installing SMART-GASP to avoid potential package conflicts. You can create and activate a conda environment with the following commands:
- ```bash conda create -n smart_gasp python=3.10 -y```
- 
### Activate the environment
- ```conda activate smart_gasp```

### To install from source
- ```git clone git@github.com:samdong2101/SMART_GASP](https://github.com/samdong2101/SMART_GASP.git```

## 2. Install required packages
- ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
