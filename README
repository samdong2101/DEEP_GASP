# SMART-GASP
This repository contains the code of the **SMART-GASP algorithm, an end-to-end machine learning integrated genetic algorithm for crystal structure prediction, containing a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network Structure Generator (WGANsg) for population initialization
and tournament based scoring/selection (TBS) of candidate offspring organisms through equivariant graph based score networks via MatterSim.
